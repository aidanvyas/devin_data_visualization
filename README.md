# Airline Safety Data Visualization

## Overview
This project provides a data visualization of the "Airline Safety" dataset from FiveThirtyEight, comparing the number of incidents and fatal accidents for various airlines across two time periods: 1985-1999 and 2000-2014.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on airline incidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities for the specified years and is sourced from the FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository.

## Visualization
The visualization is a bar chart that effectively displays the safety record of each airline, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of the data across the two time periods.

## Usage
To generate the visualization, run the `visualize_airline_safety.py` script. This will process the dataset and produce an image file `airline_safety_comparison.png` with the bar chart.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
3. Run the script: `python visualize_airline_safety.py`
